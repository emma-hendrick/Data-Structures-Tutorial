# C# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the C# Data Structures Tutorial. Knowing data structures is useful because it will allow you to ensure that you using the right tools to solve whatever problem you are trying to solve. In this tutorial we will be programming the data structures ourselves, then trying to implement them to solve some real-life problems.

We will be covering the following.

- [Stacks](1-stack.md)
- [Queues](2-queue.md)
- [Sets](3-set.md)
- [Linked Lists](4-linked-list.md)
- [Graphs](5-graph.md)
- [Trees](6-tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first. See the course outline below for a full overview of what we will be covering in this tutorial.
